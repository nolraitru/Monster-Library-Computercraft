# Monster-Library-Computercraft
Personal collection of scripts for turtles and computers in the Minecraft mod "ComputerCraft: Tweaked"

Always a work in progress. Currently only Mine and Spelunk work (with MonLib).



These are not pretty, nor effecient, but I made them and wanted to be able to access them regularly.
